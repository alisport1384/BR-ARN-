        // 1.2.8-r2 STARVATION FIX  (the "ping 2000, nothing moves" root cause)
        //
        // ## What was wrong
        //
        // The loop ran ONE `tokio::select!` per pass, and it was `biased`, so
        // the arms were polled strictly in order:
        //
        //   1. inbound_rx   (network -> app: everything being downloaded)
        //   2. cmd_rx       (open a flow, close it, resolve a name)
        //   3. data_in_rx   (app -> network: EVERYTHING being uploaded)
        //
        // `biased` means arm 2 is only polled when arm 1 is not ready. While any
        // sustained download is in progress the WireGuard reader keeps
        // `inbound_rx` non-empty at all times, so arm 1 was ready on every
        // single pass and arms 2 and 3 were NEVER REACHED. The upload direction
        // and new-flow setup were starved for as long as data kept arriving.
        //
        // That is the whole report, in one line of code:
        //   * a live dubbing session is a permanently two-way flow - it uploads
        //     ~44 KB/s of PCM while it downloads ~64 KB/s of dubbed audio. The
        //     download half kept the loop busy, the upload half never got a
        //     turn, the WebSocket write queue filled, and the RTT went to the
        //     roof. Field log: 115 MB received against 6 MB sent.
        //   * a video does the same thing with its ACK/upload path, which is why
        //     "ping jumps to 2000 and then nothing opens" also happened on plain
        //     YouTube;
        //   * the latency badge measures a NEW SOCKS5 connection, which needs
        //     `cmd_rx` (arm 2) AND `data_in_rx` (arm 3): both starved, hence
        //     "Latency probe failed: Connect timed out" while the tunnel was
        //     still moving 100 KB/s of download;
        //   * it recovers on its own the moment the download stops, because the
        //     starved arms are finally polled - which is exactly the "press stop
        //     and the ping gradually comes back" the user described, and the
        //     reason nothing anywhere logged an error.
        //
        // ## The fix
        //
        // Every queue is drained on every pass, each with its OWN budget, and
        // nothing is awaited while any of them still has work. The order the
        // three are visited in alternates, so no direction can be first (or
        // last) twice in a row. `select!` is now only reached when all three
        // queues are empty, i.e. when it is a plain "wake me up" and there is
        // nothing left to be unfair about.
