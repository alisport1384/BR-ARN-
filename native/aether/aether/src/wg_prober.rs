/// RTT a scanned endpoint has to beat before the turbo scan commits to it.
///
/// ## ROOT CAUSE this fixes
///
/// `WgScanMode::Turbo` sets `early_exit_first`, and the loop below took that
/// literally: **the first candidate that answered was returned, whatever its
/// RTT**, 0.48 s into a 30 s budget with 79 of 80 candidates still unprobed.
/// There was no quality check anywhere on the scan's own result - only on the
/// CACHED endpoint, which produced a build that openly contradicted itself.
/// From the field log, 2 ms apart:
///
/// ```text
/// [-] cached endpoint 162.159.192.115:859 answered but is slow
///     (rtt 396.851077ms over the 180ms budget); ignoring the cache and
///     scanning for a faster endpoint
/// [+] wg candidate ok 162.159.195.92:1701 rtt=475.011923ms
/// [+] selected WireGuard endpoint 162.159.195.92:1701
/// ```
///
/// It threw away a 397 ms endpoint for being too slow and then committed the
/// whole session to a 475 ms one - **79 ms worse than what it had just
/// rejected** - while the DPI fingerprint in the same second had measured
/// 104-115 ms edges on the very ranges being scanned. Every number the user has
/// screenshotted is built on top of that: the endpoint in a1 and a2 is this one,
/// and in the chained mode its RTT is paid twice.
///
/// So the gate that guards the cache now guards the scan too, and by
/// construction with the SAME number: `AETHER_SCAN_GOOD_RTT_MS` if the app sends
/// it, otherwise `AETHER_QUICK_RECONNECT_MAX_RTT_MS` (the cache budget), other-
/// wise 180 ms. It is impossible for this build to reject an endpoint as too

/// ## Why r4's gate was not enough
///
/// r4 added a quality target and its own doc comment claimed "it is impossible
/// for this build to reject an endpoint as too slow and then choose a slower
/// one." That claim was wrong, and the field log in this round shows the exact
/// hole: the target only decides whether turbo commits EARLY. When the grace
/// window closes and nothing under the target was found, the slow first answer
/// is still returned as the fallback. On the logged run that fallback is
/// 475.01 ms, and the cache that had just been discarded for being slow was
/// 396.85 ms - so the contradiction survives r4 in full, and the session still
/// ends up 78 ms worse off than doing nothing at all.
///
/// A target is an aspiration. What was missing is a FLOOR: a hard statement that
/// whatever we replace the cache with must actually be better than the cache.
///
/// So the moment quick-reconnect discards a cached endpoint for being slow, it
/// registers that endpoint and its measured RTT here. If the scan then finishes
/// without beating it, [apply_rtt_floor] returns the cached endpoint instead of
/// the slower winner. That endpoint was verified alive milliseconds earlier by
/// the very probe that measured it, so reusing it is safe by construction, and it
/// is strictly the better of the two choices available.
///
/// Net effect: rejecting the cache can now only ever IMPROVE the endpoint, never
/// degrade it. The pathological case in the log becomes "no faster edge found,
/// keeping the 396 ms cache".
